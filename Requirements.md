# Project Requirements

* Organized file tree
* One page or multi page layout. Minimum of three sections/pages
* Page Examples:
	* About, contact, resume/CV, fan page about your favorite rapper or super hero, anything is fine. Just remember though, you may want to keep it professional in the event you want to use this as your actual personal site down the road.
* You may use a frontend framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation. You may also use a template, all I ask is that you do not use it as it comes. Add your own layer of style on top of what is included.
* All pages (views and includes, etc) should be written in PHP, at least for this first part of the project
* One component/page of your site should be a contact form, I would prefer this to submit to a database, but if you want to defer the database and have it email you or write to a text file, that is ok too.

* Programming Requirements:
	* Intelligent use of topics covered in class so far. Such as:
		* Use of variables, includes, arrays, functions, file reading etc.
	* When should I use [requirement]?
		* Ex. If you have a collection of links that have text and hrefs that need to be displayed, store them in an array and correctly loop through them where you want them to display
		* Ex. Repeating some PHP more than once in a PHP block? Store it in a variable.
		* Ex. Don't want to write your header and footer on each page for a multi page approach? Use an include file. Similarly, if you have a function that you will use over and over, that should also go into an include file.
	* There are no hard requirements for what PHP to use and when. The best approach would be to use as many of the topics covered in class (appropriately) as necessary to make the site work and prove your ability
	* If you are unsure on what to use or when/how to use it, please reach out to me or a TA
